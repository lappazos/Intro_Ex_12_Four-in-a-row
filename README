=============================


==================
=  Description:  =
==================
first of all, our Gui is the best, by promise!! check out all of our cool
features - changing graphics for each player, moving in between the different
buttons replace the arrows labels, different buttons for each player, and of
course - changing Motos to encourage or discourage the players along the game.

Our game was created the following - Game Class in game.py for game logic (you
could also play it without the gui, only with console), four_in_a_row.py
contain main, Gui class, and communication implementation.

and last but not least - our glorious AI.its not stupid at all - first of all,
as needed, it won't put any discs where the columns are full(as basic rule).
second, it will check whether or not it can block the opponent in every way
possible (as long he has sequence of 2 or more discs) - if so, he'll do it.
if there isn't any sequence to block or no wat to block a current opponent
sequence, he will then try to catch up with his own players sequence (1 and
above) and try to win.
only if none of the above was successful, he will randomly choose a column from
 the optional ones (aren't full).

=  Special Comments  =
======================
Our images are the best - check it out. also, please pay attention that if
you'll try to use the same port in a network other players are using too, the
program might not open until you'll choose an open port.
